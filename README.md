# Throttle_Body_Control_Platform

## Project Overview

**Problem:** The hardware solution that Wintec has access to fails as a platform to allow testing for advanced control methods. By gaining access and the means to verify/test cutting-edge technology such as adaptive tracking control for the throttle valve. A custom Real-time controller will be used as a platform to gather data about the effectiveness of a range of different control methods

**Context:** The electronic throttle body serves as the engine component responsible for electronically managing the air intake to the engine cylinders. When the accelerator pedal is depressed, the throttle plates within the body open, allowing increased airflow into the engine. This action directly affects the vehicle's speed and torque, as it responds to changes in throttle input.

**Research:** To achieve a platform that allows for the required experimentation requires research into the following.

- Real-Time Micro Controler
